 * Gates high-frequency UI updates (progress bar sampling, animations) behind
 * conditions that only flip at expansion thresholds — not on every frame.
 *
 * [expansionFraction] is read inside [derivedStateOf], producing a Boolean that
 * changes only when crossing the 0.985 / 0.95 thresholds. This avoids per-frame
 * recomposition of the caller during gestures.
 *
 * [currentSheetState] and [bottomSheetOpenFraction] are used as `remember` keys
 * because they change infrequently (state transitions / queue sheet interactions).
